# RidePal Web Application
 
RidePal is a web application that allows users to generate playlists tailored to their musical preferences for specific travel durations. The application utilizes external services such as Microsoft Bing Maps, Deezer and Pixabay to calculate travel durations, fetch music data and attach an image to a newly created playlist in the system.
